# MicroMatch

Across developing regions, micro-entrepreneurs, farmers, vendors, riders, and artisans, keep their communities alive. Yet to the financial system, they barely exist.

Lenders want to help but can’t see past the lack of data. Middlemen step in, adding layers of bureaucracy, distrust, and sky-high interest rates.

The result?
The people who form the backbone of local economies are forced to break their backs just to survive another day.

# Big Question: Why do the people who work the hardest have the hardest time getting a loan?

That question led us to MicroMatch: an AI-driven platform that doesn’t just see numbers. It sees people.

# What Is MicroMatch?

MicroMatch uses AI to understand micro-entrepreneurs beyond paperwork.
It analyzes daily life patterns: phone activity, spending behavior, repayment consistency, even tone of communication — to build a fair, transparent portrait of trust.

Because AI shouldn’t replace humanity — it should reveal it.

MicroMatch gives visibility to the invisible economy, connecting micro-entrepreneurs with lenders who believe not just in data, but in dignity.
