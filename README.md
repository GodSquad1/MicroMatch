# MicroMatch

Across developing regions, micro-entrepreneurs, like farmers, vendors, riders, and artisans, keep their communities alive, but to the financial system, they barely exist. Lenders want to help but can’t see past the lack of data. So middlemen fill the gap, adding layers of bureaucracy, distrust, and sky-high interest rates. The result? The people who build the backbone of local economies are forced to break their backs just to survive another day. That’s where our question began: Why do the people who work the hardest have the hardest time getting a loan? And the answer led us to MicroMatch — an AI-driven platform that doesn’t see just numbers; it sees people. Instead of judging borrowers by paperwork, it reads the story behind their daily lives — phone activity, spending patterns, repayment consistency, even the tone of their words — to build a fair, transparent portrait of trust. Because AI shouldn’t replace humanity — it should reveal it. MicroMatch was born to give the invisible economy visibility — connecting micro-entrepreneurs with lenders who believe in data, but also in dignity. MicroMatch was created by using many tools and technologies, including Fast API, Uvicorn, YOLO, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, Firebase. While we were building it, we ran into numerous issues and bugs ranging from major issues to minor errors. At times our front end refused to connect to our back end due to in-compatibility issues associated with textScript Firebase integration. Initially, we focused on solving this one issue, before realizing that the same result could be achieved with local storage and emulation. This hackathon by far was the best experience we have had working together, and MicroMatch is not just the result of 9 hours of hard work and determination, but also the culmination of over a 6 months without getting close to the podium. We are confident that MicroMatch is one of the best if not the best project we have every worked on in our lives. We are so grateful for the opportunity you have provided for us and look forward to returning with an even better result next year. Looking towards our horizon, we aim to improve our product to launch on the market and benefit people across the globe.
